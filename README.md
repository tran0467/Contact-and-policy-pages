# Contact-and-policy-pages
Whilst there are several different options available for editing and viewing HTML documents, I will be standardising
my development environment to use Visual Studio Code (known as ‘VS Code’) and Google Chrome. Both are freely
available and support Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. 

All tasks were developed in VS Code and tested in Chrome. I check the validity of your HTML
markup using a validation service such as the W3C Markup Validator

My tasks are:
(1) Creating two basic HTML documents that will be modified in later
(2) Adding form fields for user input in Contact.html file
(3) Adding CSS in order to change the visual appearance of the page
